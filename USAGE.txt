1. To obtain both NavSatFix msg and Odom msg
	- run the file in this path "gps_common >> launch >> gps_activate_launchfile.sh"
		$ ./gps_activate_launchfile.sh
	* update: the odom msg is in UTM coordinates, which is not what we want

2. To obtain only NavSatFix msg
	- run the file in this path "gpsd_client >> launch >> gps_activate_launchfile.sh"
		$ ./gps_activate_launchfile.sh

*for both .sh scripts, please check the ID_SERIAL refers to the GPS module that you are currently using
